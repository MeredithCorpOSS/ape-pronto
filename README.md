# APE Pronto Rendering Engine

Speed optimized rendering engine for widget based pages.
The fastest gun in the west, and the new hotness.

There are four basic stages of pronto rendering.

* Routing: Determine the page to render based on the request
* Composing: Determine the template and widgets that need rendered.
* Rendering: Merge views, templates and view models to render the output
* Dispatching: Send the bits to the target
